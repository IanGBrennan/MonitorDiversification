I sent you the "best" models (based on AICc and LRT) from two analyses: one allowing A+C as a state and another one not permitting so.
In the first case, the preferred model is DEC+J+X, and in the second case it's DEC+J.
The DEC+J+X was preferred over the DEC+J based on the AICc (cannot use LRT because the constraints are different between the two).
I think I will use the results of the run that does not allow A+C, not just because of the AICc but because Oceania was far from Asia during the Oligocene,
and probably Oceania consisted of nothing more than a few remote and small islands at the time.
Besides an ancestral distribution of crown varanids in Eurasia makes more sense based on the fossil record (early varanids from Europe, Middle East, and Northern Africa).
